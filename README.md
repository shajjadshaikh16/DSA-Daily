# 💼 Java DSA Practice — Consistency Tracker

This repository tracks my daily progress solving **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems in **Java**, focusing on clean solutions, algorithmic thinking, and interview readiness.

> Goal: Build strong problem-solving foundations for **top tech roles** (AI Engineer, Backend Developer, ML Engineer, SDE)

## 📊 Progress Overview

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Problems Solved | **X** _(auto-updates soon)_ |
| Primary Language | Java |
| Focus Areas | Strings, Arrays, Trees, Graphs, DP |
| Consistency | Daily / Every alternate day |
| Platforms | LeetCode, GFG, Company problems |

> _Automated badges will be added once the GitHub workflow finishes testing._

## ✨ How I Write Each Solution

Every `.java` file contains:
- Short problem summary
- Time & space complexity
- Clean Java implementation
- Efficient approach targeting interviews
- Edge case coverage

---

## 🏆 Target Outcomes

- Crack DSA-focused interview rounds  
- Strengthen logical reasoning & pattern recognition  
- Build high confidence in problem solving  
- Publish progress & consistency publicly
